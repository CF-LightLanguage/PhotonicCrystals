## 2.1. Physical fundaments

Photonic crystal (PhC) is the integration of solid-state physics and electromagnetism. The following chapter focuses on comprehending these two fields of physics, investigating how the wave propagation through PhCs occurs and why certain frequency range of light are prohibited from propagating inside the crystal structure, a phenomenon known as the photonic bandgap.

### 2.1.1. Photonic crystals

“PhC can be defined as composites with a space-periodical internal structure operating at frequencies where the wavelength is comparable to the period of the structure. (…) Such regular composites are designed to operate at optical frequencies (from the far infrared range to the visible and ultraviolet light)” .
Frequency bands in which the electromagnetic waves cannot propagate through it are referred to as bandgaps. The constituents of the crystal and the geometry of the lattice define these bandgaps . Geometrically, there are three classes of PhCs represented below, each distinguished by its complexity of alternating material and dimensionality.

This study focuses on the analysis and simulation of two-dimensional PhCs, consisting of a structure composed of two alternated materials with different dielectric constants.
