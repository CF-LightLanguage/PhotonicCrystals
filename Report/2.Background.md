## 2.1. Physical fundaments

Photonic crystal (PhC) is the integration of solid-state physics and electromagnetism. The following chapter focuses on comprehending these two fields of physics, investigating how the wave propagation through PhCs occurs and why certain frequency range of light are prohibited from propagating inside the crystal structure, a phenomenon known as the photonic bandgap.

### 2.1.1. Photonic crystals

“PhC can be defined as composites with a space-periodical internal structure operating at frequencies where the wavelength is comparable to the period of the structure. (…) Such regular composites are designed to operate at optical frequencies (from the far infrared range to the visible and ultraviolet light)” .
Frequency bands in which the electromagnetic waves cannot propagate through it are referred to as bandgaps. The constituents of the crystal and the geometry of the lattice define these bandgaps . Geometrically, there are three classes of PhCs represented below, each distinguished by its complexity of alternating material and dimensionality.

This study focuses on the analysis and simulation of two-dimensional PhCs, consisting of a structure composed of two alternated materials with different dielectric constants.

### 2.1.2. Electromagnetism in Mixed Dielectric Media

The study of the propagation of light in a photonic crystal is governed by the four macroscopic Maxwell equations , described as:
∇.B=0	∇ × E+  ∂B/∂t=0
∇.D=ρ	∇ × H-  ∂D/∂t=J

Considering the propagation within a mixed dielectric medium, in which the structure does not vary with time, and there are no free charges or currents (ρ=0 and J=0), further approximations are assumed: 

1. linear regime, so that all higher-order terms ( χ_ijk)  are neglected. 
2. the material is macroscopic and isotropic, so that 
D_((r))=ε_0 ε_((r)) E_((r))  and  B_((r))=μ_0 μ_((r)) H_((r))
3. frequency dependence of the dielectric constant is ignored, since the value of   
    dielectric constant is chosen appropriate to the considered frequency range.
4. only transparent materials, so that ε_r is real and positive. 

With these, the Maxwell equations become:
∇.H_((r,t))=0	∇ × E_((r,t))+μ_0   (∂H_((r,t)))/∂t=0
∇.[ε_((r)) E_((r,t)) ]=0	∇ × H_((r,t))-ε_0 ε_((r))   (∂E_((r,t)))/∂t=0

To write a harmonic mode as a spatial pattern, the physical field can be decoupled from the complex-valued field, employing the complex exponential:
H_((r,t))=H_((r)) e^(-iωt)	E_((r,t))=E_((r)) e^(-iωt)

Converting the Maxwell equations once again into the following:
∇.H_((r))=0	∇ × E_((r))-〖iωμ〗_0  H_((r))=0
∇.[ε_((r)) E_((r)) ]=0	∇ × H_((r))+iωε_0 ε_((r))  E_((r))=0
