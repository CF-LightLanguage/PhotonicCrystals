This study aims to investigate the potential of machine learning (ML) as a complementary method in the field of photonics to characterize photonic crystals (PhCs). Making use of the available simulation software Comsol Multiphysics, the behavior of the electromagnetic wave’s propagation through the PhCs with various configurations can be demonstrated, and the resulting band structures visualized. Through supervised learning, specifically employing convolutional neural network (CNN) for image recognition, band structures can be predicted from previously unseen input data.

The first section of this study addresses the theory behind PhCs, exploring the relationship between solid states and electromagnetism, as well as the origin of band structures. Within the theoretical foundation, detailed explanations are given for the principles of ML and CNN, focusing particularly on the numerical operations essential for deep learning tasks.

The second section is structured into two parts: the first part outlines the simulation procedures for PhCs conducted within the Comsol software, while the second part provides a step-by-step explanation of the CNN architecture employed in this study.

The third section present the results of the simulation, along with graphical representations for final considerations about the accuracy of the method. Finally, a brief conclusion offers insights into the study’s findings and outlines potential next steps for further research.
